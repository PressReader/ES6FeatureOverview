### Syntactic sugar for constructing strings

##### String interpolation

```JavaScript
let name = "Bob", time = "today";
`Hello ${name}, how are you ${time}?`
```

##### Expression interpolation

```JavaScript
let a = 5, b = 10;
console.log(`Your total is ${a + b}`);
```

##### Multi-line strings

```JavaScript
let multiline = `string text line 1
string text line 2`;
```

> Template literals are enclosed by the back-tick
